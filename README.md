This project represents an implementation of PCNN [[zeng2015distant](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D15-1203)], dubbed as
*Piecewise Convolutional Neural Network*, written in Tensorflow.
Considered as an application for sentiment attitudes extraction task.

Architectures implementation:
* [[cnn](networks/architectures/cnn.py)]
* [[pcnn](networks/architectures/pcnn.py)]

Dataset
-------
We use [RuSentRel 1.0](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentRel/tree/v1.0/)
corpus consisted of analytical articles from Internet-portal
inosmi.ru.


This collection provides an attitudes for whole articles. 
Therefore it is necessary to find a **context**(s) related to each attitude -- 
a part of text, which includes Subject and Object.

For **sentiment attitudes** (about 10%) we kept all sentences that has related object and subject, and assume such contexts with the related attitude label.
> We kept all sentences (instead of the first appeared) because the lack of sentiment contexts in comparison with neutral one.

For **neutral attitudes** (about 90%) we kept only first appeared sentence that has related object and subject.


Results
-------
Model [[configuration](networks/configurations/cnn.py)].
Table below illustrates CNN/PCNN results in comparison with **baselines**
(neg, pos, distr), and **classifiers** (KNN, SVM, Random Forest)
based on handcrafted NLP features.
Last row represent an asessment of agreement between two annotators.

| Model               | Precision | Recall | F1(P,N)  |
|--------------------:|:---------:|:------:|:--------:|
|Baseline neg         |  0.03     | 0.39   | 0.05     |
|Baseline pos         |  0.02     | 0.40   | 0.04     |
|Baseline distr       |  0.05     | 0.23   | 0.08     |
|KNN                  |  0.18     | 0.06   | 0.09     |
|SVM (GRID)           |  0.09     | 0.36   | 0.15     |
|Random forest (GRID) |  0.41     | 0.21   | 0.27     |
| **CNN**  		      |  0.41     | 0.23   | **0.31** |
| **PCNN** 		      |  0.42     | 0.23   | **0.31** |
|Expert agreement     |  0.62     | 0.49   | 0.55     |

Comparison of CNN and PCNN during training process illustrated in figure below:

![alt text](docs/f1_and_cost.png)
> Using default train/test separation of RuSentRel v1.0 collection; filters=200;
window\_size=3; **left subfigure**: F1(P, N) reults per epoch fot test subset; 
**right subfigure**: cost values per epoch;
using piecewise cnn results in training speed, and latter reach better results 
faster than vanilla cnn.

> **NOTE:** For cost evaluation, we use `tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits()` which 
compares results by an exact class, not by distribution; **class weights** were not taken
into account.

Installation
------------

Using [virtualenv](https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-install-virtualenv-python/).
Create virtual environment, suppose `my_env`, and activate it as follows:
```
virtualenv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
```

Use `Makefile` to install
[core](https://github.com/nicolay-r/sentiment-erc-core) library and download
[dataset](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentRel/tree/v1.0/):
```
make install
```

We use word2vec
[model](http://rusvectores.org/static/models/rusvectores2/news_mystem_skipgram_1000_20_2015.bin.gz)
which were taken from rusvectores.org and used for an embedding layer completion:
```
make download_model
```

Usage
-----
The dataset provides only sentiment attitudes.
For extraction of positive and negative attitudes we additionally introduce
(extract from news) **neutral attudes** to distinguish really sentiment
attitudes from neutral one.

At first, we compose a list of neutral relations per each article by running:
```
./neutrals.py
```
And we are ready to apply model with different settings by simply rinning:
```
./predict_cnn.py
```
