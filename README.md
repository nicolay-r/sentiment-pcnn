This project represents an implementation of PCNN [[zeng2015distant](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D15-1203)], dubbed as
*Piecewise Convolutional Neural Network*, written in Tensorflow.
Considered as an application for sentiment attitudes extraction task.

Dataset
-------
We use [RuSentRel 1.0](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentRel/tree/v1.0/)
corpus consisted of analytical articles from Internet-portal
inosmi.ru.

Installation
------------

Using [virtualenv](https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-install-virtualenv-python/).
Create virtual environment, suppose `my_env`, and activate it as follows:
```
virtualenv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
```

Use `Makefile` to install
[re-core v0.19.1](https://github.com/nicolay-r/sentiment-erc-core/tree/release_19_1) library and download
[RuSentRel-v1.0](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentRel/tree/v1.0/):
```
make install
```

We use word2vec
[model](http://rusvectores.org/static/models/rusvectores2/news_mystem_skipgram_1000_20_2015.bin.gz)
which were taken from rusvectores.org and used for an embedding layer completion:
```
make download_model
```

Usage
-----
The dataset provides only sentiment attitudes.
For extraction of positive and negative attitudes we additionally introduce
(extract from news) **neutral attudes** to distinguish really sentiment
attitudes from neutral one.

At first, we compose a list of neutral relations per each article by running:
```
./neutrals.py
```
And we are ready to apply model (CNN) with different settings by simply running:
```
./predict/context/cnn.py
```
or PCNN as follows:
```
./predict/context/pcnn.py
```

To apply neural network to get aggregated results, use the following script next,
which evaluates result in case of different cell types of rnn modes (RNN, GRU, LSTM):
```
./predict/text/rnn_all.py
```
